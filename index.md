__The r/FireEmblemHeroes 1\* Lv.40+10 Build Compendium__
-

This is meant to highlight feats of dedication in the community, so submissions should be tied directly to a reddit username and have the permission of the owner.

If you have a 1* Lv.40+10 Hero (especially one that doesn't have an entry yet), comment in the appropriate Compendium Submission thread.

If you would like to update a previous submission, simply post a top level comment with the new build in the current submission thread. Be sure to tell us you are updating a previous submission.

If you have any questions, you can [contact the r/FireEmblemHeroes mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFireEmblemHeroes&subject=&message=)
